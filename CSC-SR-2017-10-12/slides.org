* Interaction


** Social interactions

- Participation in seminars ,workshops, group meetings, coffee breaks,
  lunches, etc.

- Helping researchers to find the right CSC's computing resources,
  courses and application support

- Helping to choose better approaches in the computational work in
  general


#+BEGIN_NOTES
"Office torpedoing", "Coffee break maths bombing"
#+END_NOTES


** Sofware support

- sofware installs on CSC's supercomputers and local workstations
  (EC-Earth, OpenIFS, NEMO, MPI-ESM, ECHAM, PALM, ASAM, FLEXPART,
  Metview, cdo, ncl, netcdf, grib-api, ...)

- workflow optimization, scripting

- Not only installing the requested software -- also teaching how to
  do it


** Education

- Mentoring, PhD and master thesis students, summer workers (engage
  early!)

- Active participation in research and teaching in Kumpula Campus,
  Numerical meteorology laboratory course


* Selected support cases


** Generalized Omega equation and Zwack-Okossi height tendencies

- Small (< 10k LoC) in-house code

- Algorithm support, programming support

- [[https://github.com/mikarant/ozo][Fortran code in GitHub]]

- Results published,
  [[https://www.google.fi/search?q=r%C3%A4is%C3%A4nen+generalized+omega+equation&client=ubuntu&hs=CUn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjTu4OUmdfWAhWDK5oKHfIpCp4Q_AUICigB&biw=1375&bih=810][Google picture search]]

- With Mika Rantanen, Jouni Räisänen, Victoria Sinclair, ...

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Super nice project.
#+END_NOTES


** Generalized Omega equation solver

- Proof of concept implementation (third re-write of the code)

- Parallel I/O with
  [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/][Netcdf4]], parallel
  [[https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/][PETSc]] solvers

- General approach

  1. [[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493%281997%29125%3C1577%3AHTDUAG%3E2.0.CO%3B2][Differential equations]] discretized using symbolic computation

  2. Solver from numerical subroutine library

- [[https://github.com/jlento/cozoc][C code in GitHub]]


#+BEGIN_NOTES
Not really used, yet. Was fun to write.
#+END_NOTES


** Ensemble prediction system

- Consultation in a complex workflow management framework

- [[https://github.com/jlento/makegraph][Makegraph in GitHub]]

- With Pirkka Ollinaho, Heikki Järvinen, Madeleine Ekblom, Lauri Tuppi, ...

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is a hard task. The best that I could do was to emphasize the
importance of picturing -- literally -- the workflow dependency graph (DAG).
#+END_NOTES


** EC-Earth ESM with aeorosol physics in CMIP6

- Huge (>1M LoC), coupled Earth system model,
  [[http://www.ec-earth.org/][EC-Earth]]

- just to get it running is a big task, let alone running it efficiently

- data publishing, [[https://esgf.llnl.gov/][ESGF]]

- With Risto Makkonen, Jukka-Pekka Keskinen, Declan O'Donell, ...

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is work in progress. I'm confident that this is doable, but the amount of
work is horrible.
#+END_NOTES


* Final words

- Do I recommend this kind of work? - Yes!

- We should increase direct on-site work

- Light version: CSC's specialists could participate to their
  favourite groups' meetings as "computing godparents"
