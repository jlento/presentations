#+BEGIN_NOTES
CSC provides extensive support for computational work in atmospheric and Earth
sciences! If computational work is giving you headaches or you would like to
attack a new problem, there is help available!
#+END_NOTES

* First, thank You for your active use of CSC's services!

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Active use of CSC's services is the best service for CSC. Atmospheric and Earth
system researchers are actively using CSC's services.
#+END_NOTES

* Big challenges in Physics --- computers and programming

*Making observations and understanding them*

- Quantitative observations, measurements (data)
- Data analysis and models (equations)
  - Simulations, testing models, making predictions

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is kind of obvious. We are using huge databases and models to understand
complex processes. Graph paper alone is not enough anymore. In addition to our
skills in mathematics and physics, the efficiency and the quality of our
research depends increasingly on our programming skills. We need to teach
programming, too.

* Education perspective to CSC's services

** Courses organized by CSC

- Short, 1-3 day courses at CSC
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/linux1_sept2017][Linux 1]]
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/csc-env-2017-2][Using CSC's environment efficiently]]
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/python_intro_2017_2][Introduction to Python]]
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/intro_fortran_2017][Fortran programming for scientific computing]]
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/introduction-to-c-programmi-2][Introduction to C programming]]
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/geocomputing_2017][Geocomputing usings CSC resources]]
- Engage students early!
- Small investment of time, potentially large benefit!

** CSC's contribution in university courses

- Resource provider, training accounts in supercomputers
- Invited lectures

** Notebooks (new!)

- Notebooks for teaching
  - [[https://csc.fi/iw/web/blog/post/-/blogs/notebooks-enemman-aikaa-opetuksen-ytimelle][Blog post]]
  - [[http://notebooks.csc.fi/][Try it!]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This was actually reminded to me by Anton Rusanen (UH) at lunch.
#+END_NOTES

** Practical things we can do

- Send the students to CSC's courses
  - Linux 1
  - Using CSC's environment efficiently
- Send the students to CSC's summer school
- Ask for mentoring support for computational work
- Promote good software development practices
- Improve attitudes towards computational work

*What more?*

#+BEGIN_NOTES
For me, mathematics, physics, computer science, and programming, are hobbies!
#+END_NOTES

** CSC' application specialists

  - Thomas Zwinger, NCoE eSTICC, glaciers, fluid dynamics
  - Jyrki Hokkanen, visualization of scientific data
  - Jan Åströn, particle models, glaciers
  - Nino Runeberg, Atte Sillanpää, chemistry
  - Seija Sirkiä, statistical analysis
  - Kylli Ek, Eduardo Gonzales, geographical data analysis
  - Zubair Maalick, finished his PhD in Atmospheric physics and has just joined
    CSC
  - Lot's of specialists at CSC, programming support 

Just to name a few...

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I'm really not the only application specialist at CSC, who likes to get involved in
research projects and teaching!
#+END_NOTES

* Computational work support for CoE ATM in particular

** Software support

- sofware installs on CSC's supercomputers and local workstations (EC-Earth,
  MPI-ESM, ECHAM, PALM, ASAM, FLEXPART, Metview, cdo, ncl, netcdf, grib-api,
  ...)
- workflow optimization, efficient resource usage, scripting

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The usual CSC software support type of things.
#+END_NOTES

** Mentoring, CoE & CSC collaboration

- not only solving problems in computational work, but also teaching how to
  solve them
- reproducible research
- active participation in research and teaching in Kumpula Campus

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I think my work is a good example of a way to improve interaction between CSC
and university. In addition to the regular email exchange and "just fixing it",
we sit together in front of the same screen and discuss 1) about the research
subject, and 2) the rationale and theory behind different aspects of the
computational work, and 3) "fix it."
#+END_NOTES

** Generalized Omega equation and Zwack-Okossi height tendencies

- Small (< 10k LoC) in-house code
- Algorithm support, programming support
- [[https://github.com/mikarant/ozo][Fortran code in GitHub]]
- Results published, [[https://www.google.fi/search?q=r%C3%A4is%C3%A4nen+generalized+omega+equation&client=ubuntu&hs=CUn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjTu4OUmdfWAhWDK5oKHfIpCp4Q_AUICigB&biw=1375&bih=810][Google picture search]]
- Mika Rantanen, Jouni Räisänen, Victoria Sinclair, ...

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Super nice project.
#+END_NOTES

** Generalized Omega equation solver

- proof of concept implementation (third re-write of the code)
- parallel I/O with [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/][Netcdf4]], parallel [[https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/][PETSc]] solvers
- [[https://github.com/jlento/cozoc][C code in GitHub]]
  1. [[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493%281997%29125%3C1577%3AHTDUAG%3E2.0.CO%3B2][Differential equations]] discretized using symbolic computation
  2. Solver from numerical subroutine library

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Not really used, yet. Was fun to write.
#+END_NOTES

** Ensemble prediction system

- consultation in a complex workflow management framework
- [[https://github.com/jlento/makegraph][Makegraph in GitHub]]
- with Pirkka Ollinaho, Heikki Järvinen, Madeleine Ekblom, Lauri Tuppi, ...

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is a hard task. The best that I could do was to emphasize the importance of
picturing -- literally -- the workflow dependency graph (DAG).
#+END_NOTES

** EC-Earth ESM with aeorosol physics in CMIP6

- huge (>1M LoC), coupled Earth system model, [[http://www.ec-earth.org/][EC-Earth]]
- just to get it running is a big task, let alone running it efficiently
- data publishing, [[https://esgf.llnl.gov/][ESGF]]
- Risto Makkonen, Jukka-Pekka Keskinen, ...

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is work in progress. I'm confident that this is doable, but the amount of
work is horrible.
#+END_NOTES

* Slogans

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Obviously, if it is computers related, Google it...
#+END_NOTES

** Don't be Computer, be Programmer!

#+BEGIN_NOTES
If you find yourself doing something repeatedly, stop, and program the computer
to do it for you.
#+END_NOTES

** Don't just sit there, do something!

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Don't wait for file I/O, file transfers, execution in development cycle,
response from CSC, etc...
