## Why Git and Git repository servers

- encourages to think "programming" as software development project
- provides safety net, roll backs, and a framework for collaborative software development
- integration to other services, such as GitHub Pages
- many options for remote repository hosting, [GitHub\*](https://github.com),
[Bitbucket\*\*](https://bitbucket.org), and
[University's GitLab server\*\*\*](https://version.helsinki.fi)

## Local Git repository

The most important concepts are described in
[Git Basics*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics),
especially the last section, "The Three Stages."

What git command
- moves files from *Working Directory* to *Staging Area*?
- moves files from *Staging Area* to *Repository*?
- moves files from *Repository* to *Working Directory*?

Draw a picture!
