## Local Git repository

The most important concepts are described in
[Git Basics*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics),
especially the last chapter, "The Three Stages."

- moves a file from *Working Directory* to *Staging Area*?
- moves a file from *Staging Area* to *Repository*?
- moves a file from *Repository* to *Working Directory*?
