# Software and revision control

===

## Small intro to revision control with Git

I'll emphasis *concepts* over *details*. Concretely, knowing concepts

- makes it easier to find the details
- helps to understand the error messages

## What is revision control and what are Git and GitHub?

- source code with history, and much, much more

Let's find out!

===

## Why Git and Git repository servers?

- encourages to think "programming" as more organized software development
- provides safety net and a framework for collaborative software development
- integration to other services, such as GitHub Pages
- many options for remote repository hosting, [GitHub\*](https://github.com),
[Bitbucket\*\*](https://bitbucket.org), and
[University's GitLab server\*\*\*](https://version.helsinki.fi)

What was it like before revision control, Git and remote repositories?
Tarballs and directories with files in some state scattered in mailboxes
and in various machines and user accounts?

===

## What to put into a source repository?

Source code, of course!

- basically anything that someone has typed
- *Commit* new features, bug fixes, etc, instead of modifications in single
  files

What not to put into source code repository?

- binary data: jpgs, data sets, executables, pdfs, PowerPoint slides
- automatically generated text, program output

This keeps the repository small and quick to work with.

===

## Local Git repository

The most important concepts are described in
[Git Basics*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics),
especially the last section, "The Three Stages."

What git command
- moves (adds) files from *Working Directory* to *Staging Area*?
- moves (commits) files from *Staging Area* to *Repository*?
- moves (checkouts) files from *Repository* to *Working Directory*?

*Draw a picture!*

A bonus exercise: commands that move files to opposite directions?

===

## Remote Git repository

Let's just dive into it!

- create GitHub account
- *fork* this *upstream repository*
- *clone* your forked remote repository into a local one

https://help.github.com

===

## Config and Branches

Some first things to try:

- tell (set/config) git your name and email address
- list all branches

Some pointers:

- https://help.github.com/categories/setup/
- https://github.com/joshnh/Git-Commands

There's plenty more good docs in the internet. Collect you own set!

===

## Wrapping up

Find the commands that do the following tasks, and *draw a picture *  (you can work together!):

- how to *push* your changes in the local repo to your forked repo
- how to *fetch* changes in the *upstream* repo to a *branch* in your local repo
- how to *merge* upstream branch into your *master* branch

Drawing the picture is most important. If you actually can do this now, you are
pretty skilled in using git!

## Where next

- NeIC Coderefinery has an extensive [Git course\*](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/),
[lectures](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/2018-12-11-espoo/) at Aalto University 11.12.2018.
- practice, experiment, explore, find your own way!
