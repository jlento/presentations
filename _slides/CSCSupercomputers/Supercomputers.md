## What is a supercomputer?

In practice all contemporary supercomputers are clusters of *tightly coupled
workstations*.

Workstations themselves are parallel computers with *multiple cores* and memory
hierarchies.

Parallel file systems run on clusters of file servers.

--

## Cluster architecture

![Cluster architecture](./SupercomputerArchitecture.svg "Juha's Incscape art")

*Login nodes*, tightly interconnected *compute nodes*, and accompanying
*parallel file system*.

--

## Login node

A regular multi-user Linux workstation with

- interface to compute nodes through batch queue system
- custom software stack

--

## Compute node

![Compute node](./ComputeNode.svg "Juha's Incscape art")

Compute nodes are parallel computers with multiple cores... like your smart
phone or laptop!

--

## Parallel file system

![Parallel file system](./ParallelFileSystem.svg "Juha's Incscape art")

Parallel filesystem (Lustre) consists of a MetaData Server (MDS) and
an array of large file servers (Object Data Server, ODS).

--

## Parallel file system (cont.)

**Keeping thing reasonable**

- avoid excessive metadata access.
- no more than 500 files in a single directory
- single file size < 1GB

---

## When to use a supercomputer

- need for large CPU and GPU resources
  *and a program that can use them*
    - parallel MPI programs
    - farming calculations, i.e. running the same program on different inputs,
      such as parameter searches
- sharing large data sets
- sharing hard to install programs

--

## When not to use a supercomputer

- code development, in most cases

Weight the added complexity of supercomputer environment vs. the
increase in resources.

Optimize the workflow so that it runs fast enough in a workstation?

--

## First law of computing

First law of computing:

`$$ I \times P = C$$`

where `$I$` stands for Intelligence, `$P$` is the amount of the raw computing
Power used, and `$C$` is the difficulty of the problem (...humour).

---

## How to apply CSC resources?

1. Sign up, i.e. apply **CSC account**
    - easy if you can authenticate with HAKA
2. Join to a **computing project**, or apply a new one
3. Apply for **resources** to your computing project

All this stuff (and alike) is done in  
<https://my.csc.fi>.

## How to login?

<https://research.csc.fi/csc-guide-connecting-the-servers-of-csc>

- ssh, for simple tasks
- NoMachine remote desktop, for GUI and real work

NoMachine remote desktop has big advantages over plain ssh, and needs to be set
up only once.

--

### NoMachine tips

Pleasant experience requires couple of tweaks...

- From the NoMachine window right corner peel up menu
    - if you see scroll bars, set the remote desktop size to match 1:1 to your
      window size
    -  crank up the display quality

--

### NoMachine tips (cont.)

- Use the very basic default terminal only to launch Gnome terminal(s) with easy customization, like font size, etc.
  ```bash
  gnome-terminal &
  ```
- cut'n'paste between desktop and host works... when you find the right keys...

## Supercomputing skills

Linux command line skills (which you can learn in CSC's courses "Linux 1-3"):

- working with the directory hierarchy and files
- editing text files with `nano`, `vi` or `emacs`
- optionally, how to develop and build programs in Linux

Plus the supercomputer specifics...

--

### Supercomputer environment vs. regular workstation

1. multiple versions of software packages
2. more complicated filesystem(s)
3. batch queue system

---

## How to run programs?

Computers have no common sense. They will execute every command you give, no
matter how crazy. As a human, you need to know exactly what you are asking, and
exercise your common sense.

There are quite a few important concepts, such as a *process* and a *thread*,
and...

--

### Environment modules

**What and why**: Most programs, *dynamically linked* ones, need to find the
same libraries at the executable *build time* and at the *run time*. Currently
this relies on the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. (Try `ldd` command!)

**How**: Set the same shell environment at build and at run time with
*environment modules*.

There are other uses for environment modules, too.

--

### What to run on a login node?

You can build executables, run small programs, pre- and post-process data,
visualize data, move data, etc. on **login nodes**, as long as it does not
affect other users on the same login node. Try `top` command!

--

### What to run on interactive compute nodes (taito-shell)?

Use `taito-shell` for longer interactive typeish tasks.

Note: `taito-shell` is just a compute node. It's local system tools are not necessary 100% same as in the login node.

--

### What to run on compute nodes?

- all heavier production calculations, whether massively parallel or farming
  type

The compute nodes are accessed through *batch queue system*.

---

## Parallel computing

Three kinds of parallelism:

- Farming
- Thread parallelism
- Message passing, MPI

You can test and use all three of these approaches in you workstation or laptop.
Supercomputers are needed when you scale up the problem size.

And all three can be combined, too.

--

### Farming

Independent processes run in parallel, usually running the same program on
different inputs, such as, image analysis frame by frame, parameter searches,
etc.

- may run in multiple different compute nodes
- often uses separate steps to collect and analyze the results from the
  individual runs
- lot's of intermediate files


--

### Thread parallelism

Thread parallel programs can use multiple treads within a process to utilize
multiple cores.

- works within a workstation / compute node, only
- often built into the executable with OpenMP compiler directives
- often use environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to control the number of
  threads to launch

--

### MPI parallelism

Multiple processes, possibly in different compute nodes, are launched
simultaneously, and communicate by exchanging messages.

- requires a separate program that launches the processes, called `srun`
  (taito.csc.fi), `mpirun` or `mpiexec` (regular workstations and laptops),
  `aprun` (sisu.csc.fi)
- is integrated with the batch queue system

--

### Scaling

Parallelel computing has an overhead, always. It may come from I/O, message
passing, cache misses, etc. See [Amdahl's
law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law), for example.

The important advice to remember, is to always make sure that the parallel
calculation actually is faster, and using the resources efficiently.

---

## Batch queue system

Batch queue system allocates resources for your calculation from the compute
nodes according to your *batch job script*, and launces it when resources are
available. See command `sbatch`.

Batch queue system tries to pack everybody's requests into the compute nodes as
efficiently and fairly as possible.

--

### Using multiple cores for parameter searches and other farming calculations

Use [*Array jobs*](https://research.csc.fi/taito-array-jobs) for farming type
calculations.

[![Array jobs](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EqUKIPSlvW8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEjCPYBEIoBSFryq4qpAxUIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJDeAE=&rs=AOn4CLAziT6GwUoHWXHbpBr4en4wBKKi4g)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqUKIPSlvW8)

--

### Using multiple cores with MPI parallel program

Batch job script is executed only on the first reserved CPU core. Use command
`srun` in the script to spawn the executable, usually a MPI parallel program, on
all the reserved CPU cores.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p parallel
#SBATCH -n 16
#SBATCH -t 3600

module load hugs flowers

cd $WRKDIR/topsecret
srun worlddomination
```

## Be a programmer, not a computer!

-  **KIS**, Keep It Simple
-  **DRY**, Don't Repeat Yourself

**More** *enjoyable* **and** *productive* **working with computers**
