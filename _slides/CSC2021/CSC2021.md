## Puhti

Puhti is CSC's general purpose computing cluster for jobs ranging from one to
few hundreds of CPU cores, or GPUs.

Puhti is currently used for running EC-Earth and CMIP6 experiments.

You can run Jupyter notebooks, RStudio in Puhti already, and it will be
even easier when CSC lauches new web based interface to computing
servers.


## Mahti

Mahti is CSC's computing cluster for large parallel jobs, ranging from hundred
to tens of thousands of CPU cores. It also has a sizable GPU partition.

Mahti could well be used for running EC-Earth, too. If someone would like to
try, let me know!


## Allas

Allas is CSC's server for projects' life-time data storage and for data sharing.
Data is accessible through https.

Allas is good platform for building data sharing services, similar to ESGF for
CMIP6.


## Pouta, Rahti, Kaivos

If you need to run a web service or otherwise need a separate (virtual) server,
CSC offers

- Pouta [https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/)
  cloud platform and
- Rahti [https://rahti.csc.fi](https://rahti.csc.fi) container cloud platform.

If you need a database accessible from CSC's machines, we have Kaivos.


## ESGF Data node

INAR and FMI participate in the CMIP6 experiment. The results are published via
ESGF Data node `esgf-data.csc.fi`, a special service hosted by CSC.

Risto Makkonen (UH), Mikko Aalto (FMI), Arto Aniluoto (CSC).


## Lumi

Lumi is the new supercomputer for european research hosted by CSC. It is mainly
a huge GPU cluster, with sizable CPU partition and different storage servers for
pre- and post-processing data.


## Support

Both INAR and FMI have agreements with CSC for dedicated (on-site) support on
top of the regular user support.
