#+TITLE: Support for computational work in Kumpula Campus
#+AUTHOR: Juha Lento (CSC)


#+BEGIN_NOTES
There is on campus support for computational work! If computational work is
giving you headaches or you would like to attack a new problem, there is help
available! Everybody knows that, right?
#+END_NOTES


* First, thank You for your active use of CSC's services!

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Active use of CSC's services is the best service for CSC. Atmospheric and Earth
system researchers are actively using CSC's services.
#+END_NOTES


* CSC?

- Non-profit company owned by Ministry of education and culture
- Services mainly free for researchers
- Training in scientific computing
- 4250 registered users (2012)
- Applications, computational capacity, user support, FUNET, information management services, data services
- Participating in 18 EU projects

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Just checking if there is someone who is not already familiar with CSC.
#+END_NOTES


* Big challenges in Physics --- computers and programming

*Making observations and understanding them*

- Quantitative observations, measurements (data)
- Data analysis and models (equations)
  - Simulations, testing models, making predictions

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is kind of obvious. We are using huge databases and models to understand
complex processes. Graph paper alone is not enough anymore. In addition to our
skills in mathematics and physics, the efficiency and the quality of our
research depends increasingly on our programming skills. We need to teach
programming, too. Term programming can be taken very loosely here.

* Teaching perspective to CSC's services

** Computational work teaching

Balance between mathematics, physics and programming

#+BEGIN_NOTES
My view is definitely biased. I'd like to hear your thoughts!

** Courses organized by CSC

- short, 1-3 day courses at CSC
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/linux1_sept2017][Linux 1]]
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/csc-env-2017-2][Using CSC's environment efficiently]]
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/python_intro_2017_2][Introduction to Python]]
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/intro_fortran_2017][Fortran programming for scientific computing]]
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/introduction-to-c-programmi-2][Introduction to C programming]]
  - [[https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/geocomputing_2017][Geocomputing usings CSC resources]]
- engage students early!
- small investment of time, potentially large benefit!

** CSC's contribution in university courses

- Laboratory course in numerical meteorology
  - planning
  - course material
  - lectures, exercises
- invited lectures?
- lecture series, such as [[http://science-it.aalto.fi/scip/][Scientific computing in practice]] (Aalto)?
- CSC's courses as a part of university course?

** Mentoring, FCoE & CSC collaboration

- not only solving computational challenges, but also teaching how to approach them
- active participation in research projects and mentoring in Dynamical
  meteorology group

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I think my work is a good example of a way to improve interaction between CSC
and university.
#+END_NOTES


** CSC' application specialists

  - Thomas Zwinger, NCoE eSTICC, glaciers, fluid dynamics
  - Jyrki Hokkanen, visualization of scientific data
  - Jan Åströn, particle models, glaciers
  - Nino Runeberg, chemistry
  - Seija Sirkiä, statistical analysis
  - Kylli Ek, Eduardo Gonzales, geographical data analysis
  - Lot's of specialists at CSC, programming support 

Just to name a few...

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I'm not the only application specialist at CSC, who likes to get involved in
research projects and teaching!
#+END_NOTES


* Practical things we can do

- send the students to CSC's courses
  - Linux 1
  - Using CSC's environment efficiently
- send the students to CSC's summer school
- ask for mentoring support for computational work
- promote good software development practices
- improve attitudes towards computational work

*What more?*

#+BEGIN_NOTES
For me, mathematics, physics, computer science, and programming, are hobbies!

* Slogans

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Obviously, if it is computers related, Google it...

** Don't be Computer, be Programmer!

#+BEGIN_NOTES
If you find yourself doing something repeatedly, stop, and program the computer
to do it for you.
#+END_NOTES

** Don't just sit there, do something!

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Don't wait for file I/O, file transfers, execution in development cycle,
response from CSC, etc...
